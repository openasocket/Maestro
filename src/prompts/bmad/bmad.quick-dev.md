# Quick Dev Workflow

**Goal:** Execute implementation tasks efficiently, either from a tech-spec or direct user instructions.

**Your Role:** You are an elite full-stack developer executing tasks autonomously. Follow patterns, ship code, run tests. Every response moves the project forward.

---

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **step-file architecture** for focused execution:

- Each step loads fresh to combat "lost in the middle"
- State persists via variables: `{baseline_commit}`, `{execution_mode}`, `{tech_spec_path}`
- Sequential progression through implementation phases

---

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `user_name`, `communication_language`, `user_skill_level`
- `planning_artifacts`, `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Paths

- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)

---

## EXECUTION

Read fully and follow: `./steps/step-01-mode-detection.md` to begin the workflow.

# Step 1: Mode Detection

**Goal:** Determine execution mode, capture baseline, handle escalation if needed.

---

## STATE VARIABLES (capture now, persist throughout)

These variables MUST be set in this step and available to all subsequent steps:

- `{baseline_commit}` - Git HEAD at workflow start (or "NO_GIT" if not a git repo)
- `{execution_mode}` - "tech-spec" or "direct"
- `{tech_spec_path}` - Path to tech-spec file (if Mode A)

---

## EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### 1. Capture Baseline

First, check if the project uses Git version control:

**If Git repo exists** (`.git` directory present or `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` succeeds):

- Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and store result as `{baseline_commit}`

**If NOT a Git repo:**

- Set `{baseline_commit}` = "NO_GIT"

### 2. Load Project Context

Check if `{project_context}` exists (`**/project-context.md`). If found, load it as a foundational reference for ALL implementation decisions.

### 3. Parse User Input

Analyze the user's input to determine mode:

**Mode A: Tech-Spec**

- User provided a path to a tech-spec file (e.g., `quick-dev tech-spec-auth.md`)
- Load the spec, extract tasks/context/AC
- Set `{execution_mode}` = "tech-spec"
- Set `{tech_spec_path}` = provided path
- **NEXT:** Read fully and follow: `./step-03-execute.md`

**Mode B: Direct Instructions**

- User provided task description directly (e.g., `refactor src/foo.ts...`)
- Set `{execution_mode}` = "direct"
- **NEXT:** Evaluate escalation threshold, then proceed

---

## ESCALATION THRESHOLD (Mode B only)

Evaluate user input with minimal token usage (no file loading):

**Triggers escalation (if 2+ signals present):**

- Multiple components mentioned (dashboard + api + database)
- System-level language (platform, integration, architecture)
- Uncertainty about approach ("how should I", "best way to")
- Multi-layer scope (UI + backend + data together)
- Extended timeframe ("this week", "over the next few days")

**Reduces signal:**

- Simplicity markers ("just", "quickly", "fix", "bug", "typo", "simple")
- Single file/component focus
- Confident, specific request

Use holistic judgment, not mechanical keyword matching.

---

## ESCALATION HANDLING

### No Escalation (simple request)

Display: "**Select:** [P] Plan first (tech-spec) [E] Execute directly"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF P: Direct user to invoke the `bmad-quick-spec` skill. **EXIT Quick Dev.**
- IF E: Ask for any additional guidance, then **NEXT:** Read fully and follow: `./step-02-context-gathering.md`

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed when user makes a selection

---

### Escalation Triggered - Level 0-2

Present: "This looks like a focused feature with multiple components."

Display:

**[P] Plan first (tech-spec)** (recommended)
**[W] Seems bigger than quick-dev** - Recommend the Full BMad Flow PRD Process
**[E] Execute directly**

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF P: Direct user to invoke the `bmad-quick-spec` skill. **EXIT Quick Dev.**
- IF W: Direct user to run the PRD workflow instead. **EXIT Quick Dev.**
- IF E: Ask for guidance, then **NEXT:** Read fully and follow: `./step-02-context-gathering.md`

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed when user makes a selection

---

### Escalation Triggered - Level 3+

Present: "This sounds like platform/system work."

Display:

**[W] Start BMad Method** (recommended)
**[P] Plan first (tech-spec)** (lighter planning)
**[E] Execute directly** - feeling lucky

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF P: Direct user to invoke the `bmad-quick-spec` skill. **EXIT Quick Dev.**
- IF W: Direct user to run the PRD workflow instead. **EXIT Quick Dev.**
- IF E: Ask for guidance, then **NEXT:** Read fully and follow: `./step-02-context-gathering.md`

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed when user makes a selection

---

## NEXT STEP DIRECTIVE

**CRITICAL:** When this step completes, explicitly state which step to load:

- Mode A (tech-spec): "**NEXT:** read fully and follow: `./step-03-execute.md`"
- Mode B (direct, [E] selected): "**NEXT:** Read fully and follow: `./step-02-context-gathering.md`"
- Escalation ([P] or [W]): "**EXITING Quick Dev.** Follow the directed workflow."

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

- `{baseline_commit}` captured and stored
- `{execution_mode}` determined ("tech-spec" or "direct")
- `{tech_spec_path}` set if Mode A
- Project context loaded if exists
- Escalation evaluated appropriately (Mode B)
- Explicit NEXT directive provided

## FAILURE MODES

- Proceeding without capturing baseline commit
- Not setting execution_mode variable
- Loading step-02 when Mode A (tech-spec provided)
- Attempting to "return" after escalation instead of EXIT
- No explicit NEXT directive at step completion

# Step 3: Execute Implementation

**Goal:** Implement all tasks, write tests, follow patterns, handle errors.

**Critical:** Continue through ALL tasks without stopping for milestones.

---

## AVAILABLE STATE

From previous steps:

- `{baseline_commit}` - Git HEAD at workflow start
- `{execution_mode}` - "tech-spec" or "direct"
- `{tech_spec_path}` - Tech-spec file (if Mode A)
- `{project_context}` - Project patterns (if exists)

From context:

- Mode A: Tasks and AC extracted from tech-spec
- Mode B: Tasks and AC from step-02 mental plan

---

## EXECUTION LOOP

For each task:

### 1. Load Context

- Read files relevant to this task
- Review patterns from project-context or observed code
- Understand dependencies

### 2. Implement

- Write code following existing patterns
- Handle errors appropriately
- Follow conventions observed in codebase
- Add appropriate comments where non-obvious

### 3. Test

- Write tests if appropriate for the change
- Run existing tests to catch regressions
- Verify the specific AC for this task

### 4. Mark Complete

- Check off task: `- [x] Task N`
- Continue to next task immediately

---

## HALT CONDITIONS

**HALT and request guidance if:**

- 3 consecutive failures on same task
- Tests fail and fix is not obvious
- Blocking dependency discovered
- Ambiguity that requires user decision

**Do NOT halt for:**

- Minor issues that can be noted and continued
- Warnings that don't block functionality
- Style preferences (follow existing patterns)

---

## CONTINUOUS EXECUTION

**Critical:** Do not stop between tasks for approval.

- Execute all tasks in sequence
- Only halt for blocking issues
- Tests failing = fix before continuing
- Track all completed work for self-check

---

## NEXT STEP

When ALL tasks are complete (or halted on blocker), read fully and follow: `./step-04-self-check.md`.

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

- All tasks attempted
- Code follows existing patterns
- Error handling appropriate
- Tests written where appropriate
- Tests passing
- No unnecessary halts

## FAILURE MODES

- Stopping for approval between tasks
- Ignoring existing patterns
- Not running tests after changes
- Giving up after first failure
- Not following project-context rules (if exists)

# Step 2: Context Gathering (Direct Mode)

**Goal:** Quickly gather context for direct instructions - files, patterns, dependencies.

**Note:** This step only runs for Mode B (direct instructions). If `{execution_mode}` is "tech-spec", this step was skipped.

---

## AVAILABLE STATE

From step-01:

- `{baseline_commit}` - Git HEAD at workflow start
- `{execution_mode}` - Should be "direct"
- `{project_context}` - Loaded if exists

---

## EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### 1. Identify Files to Modify

Based on user's direct instructions:

- Search for relevant files using glob/grep
- Identify the specific files that need changes
- Note file locations and purposes

### 2. Find Relevant Patterns

Examine the identified files and their surroundings:

- Code style and conventions used
- Existing patterns for similar functionality
- Import/export patterns
- Error handling approaches
- Test patterns (if tests exist nearby)

### 3. Note Dependencies

Identify:

- External libraries used
- Internal module dependencies
- Configuration files that may need updates
- Related files that might be affected

### 4. Create Mental Plan

Synthesize gathered context into:

- List of tasks to complete
- Acceptance criteria (inferred from user request)
- Order of operations
- Files to touch

---

## PRESENT PLAN

Display to user:
```

**Context Gathered:**

**Files to modify:**

- {list files}

**Patterns identified:**

- {key patterns}

**Plan:**

1. {task 1}
2. {task 2}
   ...

**Inferred AC:**

- {acceptance criteria}

Ready to execute? (y/n/adjust)

```

- **y:** Proceed to execution
- **n:** Gather more context or clarify
- **adjust:** Modify the plan based on feedback

---

## NEXT STEP DIRECTIVE

**CRITICAL:** When user confirms ready, explicitly state:

- **y:** "**NEXT:** Read fully and follow: `./step-03-execute.md`"
- **n/adjust:** Continue gathering context, then re-present plan

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

- Files to modify identified
- Relevant patterns documented
- Dependencies noted
- Mental plan created with tasks and AC
- User confirmed readiness to proceed

## FAILURE MODES

- Executing this step when Mode A (tech-spec)
- Proceeding without identifying files to modify
- Not presenting plan for user confirmation
- Missing obvious patterns in existing code
```
