/**
 * Permission broker (main process).

 * The single authorization gate between a sandboxed plugin's RPC calls and the

 * target, then checks the plugin's granted permissions with the pure
 * default-deny matcher. It does NOT execute the call - the sandbox host does
 * that only after `authorize` returns allowed. Keeping authorization separate
 * from execution means this gate can be unit-tested exhaustively without any
 * Electron or fs.
