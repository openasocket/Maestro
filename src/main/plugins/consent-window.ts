/**
 * Plugin consent window (main process).
 *
 * Creates the dedicated, host-owned, non-extensible window that shows a plugin's
 * permission request and collects the user's approval. It is the ONLY trusted
 * confirmer of a `ConsentMinter` prompt:
 *
 * - It loads its OWN minimal page (`consent.html`) with its OWN minimal preload
 *   (`consent-preload.js`) that exposes nothing but the consent bridge — never
 *   the main Maestro SPA or its full preload, so a plugin can neither render into
 *   it nor reach a richer IPC surface through it.
 * - It is a modal, non-resizable, menu-less child window — not an in-page modal a
 *   plugin-controlled surface could overlay or spoof.
 * - The offer (including the one-time nonce) is handed to it ONLY via
 *   `additionalArguments`, readable solely by this window's preload.
 *
 * `openConsentWindow` returns the window's `ConsentSender` (webContents id + main
 * frame routing id + url) so the confirm IPC can verify a `plugins:confirm-consent`
 * call actually came from this exact frame.
