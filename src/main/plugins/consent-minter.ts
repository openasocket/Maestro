/**
 * Consent minter — anti-forgery core (main process).
 *
 * Authorization can only be minted through a consent prompt the MAIN process
 * itself opened. This registry issues a one-time, short-lived nonce when the
 * minter opens a prompt for a specific {pluginId, offered capabilities}; the
 * confirm must echo that exact nonce and may only approve a SUBSET of the
 * offered capabilities. A forged, replayed, expired, wrong-plugin, or
 * never-offered request is rejected.
 *
 * This is the part that's pure and exhaustively testable. The IPC layer adds the
 * other two checks the contract requires — the sender is the trusted, host-owned
 * consent surface (`event.senderFrame`), and the confirm carries a real user
 * activation — neither of which any plugin-controlled surface can satisfy.
