/**
 * Broker-only preload for plugin panel <webview> guests (FC6 render host).
 *
 * This is the ENTIRE main-world-adjacent surface of a plugin panel. It exposes
 * NOTHING on `window` (no contextBridge), holds no state, and performs exactly
 * one job: forward the panel's existing postMessage bridge shape
 *
 *     { type: 'maestro:invokeCommand', commandId: string, args?: unknown }
 *
 * to the embedder renderer via `ipcRenderer.sendToHost` (surfacing there as an
 * `ipc-message` event on the <webview> element), where it is namespaced to the
 * owning plugin and forwarded over the broker-gated `plugins:invoke-command`
 * RPC. The panel keeps calling `parent.postMessage(...)` exactly as it did in
 * the srcdoc-iframe era — in a top-level guest `parent === window`, so the
 * message dispatches on the guest window and this isolated-world listener
 * receives it. One-way, fire-and-forget: nothing is ever sent back into the
 * page, and no reply channel exists.
 *
 * Gates:
 * - `event.source === window`: only the panel document's OWN scripts pass.
 *   The embedder cannot postMessage into a guest (separate process), and
 *   subframes cannot exist (CSP `child-src 'none'; frame-src 'none'`).
 * - Shape check: exactly `type === 'maestro:invokeCommand'` with a string
 *   `commandId`; anything else is ignored.
 *
 * Self-contained on purpose (mirrors consent.ts): imports nothing outside
 * `electron`, so its audit surface is this one file. The channel/shape
 * constants are duplicated from `src/shared/plugins/panel-host.ts`
 * (PANEL_BRIDGE_CHANNEL) — keep them in sync.
