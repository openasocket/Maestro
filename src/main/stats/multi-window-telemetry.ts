/**
 * Multi-Window Usage Telemetry Wiring
 *
 * Subscribes to the {@link WindowRegistry} change signal and records aggregate
 * multi-window usage (secondary windows opened + peak concurrent window count)
 * into the stats database. This is the main-process counterpart to the renderer's
 * `stats:*` IPC writers - window open/close happens entirely in the main process,
 * so the registry is the natural funnel.
 *
 * What is recorded, and why it is aggregate-only:
 *  - `windows_opened` increments only for SECONDARY window opens. The primary
 *    window opens once per launch and is not "multi-window" usage, so counting it
 *    would conflate app launches with the feature this telemetry measures.
 *  - `peak_concurrent` is sampled from the full registry size (primary included)
 *    at each secondary open. The concurrent count only rises when a window opens,
 *    so sampling on open captures the true daily peak. A peak below 2 means the
 *    user never ran more than one window.
 *
 * No agent ids, session contents, or window ids are stored - just a date and two
 * integers. Everything is gated on the user's `statsCollectionEnabled` setting:
 * when analytics are off, nothing is recorded.
