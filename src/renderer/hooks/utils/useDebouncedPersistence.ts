/**
 * useDebouncedPersistence.ts
 *
 * A hook that debounces session persistence to reduce disk writes.
 * During AI streaming, sessions can change 100+ times per second.
 * This hook batches those changes and writes at most once every 2 seconds.
 *
 * Persistence path (after PR-A 1.1):
 *  - First flush after load: ship the entire prepared sessions array via
 *    `sessions:setAll`. This seeds the main process and establishes a
 *    diff baseline (`previouslyPersistedRef`).
 *  - Subsequent flushes: diff `sessionsRef.current` against the baseline
 *    using reference equality per session, then ship only the changed
 *    sessions plus the ids of any removed sessions via
 *    `sessions:setMany`. With Zustand's immutable update pattern, every
 *    mutated session gets a fresh object reference — so the diff catches
 *    every real change in O(N) without needing per-mutator dirty
 *    tracking.
 *
 * Why diff in the hook rather than tracking dirty IDs in the store: the
 * 200+ existing `setSessions((prev) => prev.map(...))` call sites use
 * the functional updater form. Wrapping every site to record dirty IDs
 * would risk regressions; reference-diff captures the same information
 * in one place with no caller-side changes.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Configurable debounce delay (default 2 seconds)
 * - Flush-on-unmount to prevent data loss
 * - isPending state for UI feedback
 * - flushNow() for immediate persistence at critical moments

// ballooning sessions.json to 500MB+ and OOM-ing the main process on startup

 * Prepare a session for persistence by:
 * 1. Filtering out tabs with active wizard state (incomplete wizards should not persist)
 * 2. Truncating logs in each AI tab to MAX_PERSISTED_LOGS_PER_TAB entries
 * 3. Resetting runtime-only state (busy state, thinking time, etc.)
 * 4. Excluding runtime-only fields (closedTabHistory, agentError, etc.)
 *
 * Exception: a limit pause (a token/API/credit/rate limit the agent can resume
 * from) is deliberately persisted - `state: 'error'`, `agentError`,
 * `agentErrorPaused`, `agentErrorTabId`, and the paused tab's `agentError`. This
 * is what lets Auto-Resume On Limit survive an app restart: on a cold start the
 * coordinator re-finds the paused session and resumes the agent conversation
 * (via the agent's native `--resume`) once its provider window reopens. Every
 * OTHER error stays stripped - a stale auth/crash error must not survive a
 * restart. Note: the in-memory Auto Run / goal-run ORCHESTRATION loop is NOT
 * persisted; only the agent session and its `executionQueue` resume.
 *
 * This ensures sessions don't get stuck in busy state after app restart,
 * since underlying processes are gone after restart.
 *
 * Incomplete wizard tabs are discarded because:
 * - They represent temporary wizard sessions that haven't completed
 * - Completed wizards have their wizardState cleared and tab converted to regular sessions
 * - Restoring incomplete wizard state would leave the user in a broken state
 *
 * This is a local copy to avoid circular imports in session persistence logic.
