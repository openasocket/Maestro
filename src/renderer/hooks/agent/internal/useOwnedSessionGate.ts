/**
 * useOwnedSessionGate — window-scoping for incoming `process:*` events.
 *
 * The main process BROADCASTS every `process:*` event (data, exit, status, ...)
 * to ALL windows (see the MULTI-WINDOW INVARIANT in `safe-send.ts`). Each
 * window must therefore drop events for agents it does not own, otherwise a
 * non-owning window would append another agent's output to its store and - far
 * worse - re-run the one-shot `onExit` / `onAgentError` side effects (synopsis
 * spawn, git refresh, history entry, batch pause) once per open window.
 *
 * Ownership truth lives in exactly one place: `WindowContext.ownsSession`
 * (the primary window is the catch-all owner; a secondary window owns its
 * explicit scoped set). This hook reuses that predicate rather than
 * re-deriving ownership, and exposes it as a STABLE ref so the high-frequency
 * IPC listeners can sit in a `useEffect` dependency array without
 * re-subscribing every time ownership changes (re-subscribing would risk
 * dropping events mid-swap - keyboard/event reliability is non-negotiable).
 *
 * Null-safe: outside a `WindowProvider` (isolation tests) the gate permits
 * everything, so single-window behaviour is unchanged. The web-desktop build
 * mounts a `WindowProvider` but its `ownsSession` is a permit-all by design
 * (a browser client mirrors every agent - see `WindowContext`).
