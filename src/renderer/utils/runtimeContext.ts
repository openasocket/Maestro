 *   3. SSR/test environments where `window` may not exist

 * Components use `isWebDesktop()` to hide destructive UI that assumes
 * Electron-host lifecycle — toggling the LIVE webserver off from inside
 * the bridge would kill the browser's own connection, and "Quit",
 * "Restart", and "Check for Updates" have no meaning when the user isn't
 * running the Electron binary directly.
