		//      same basePath adopt this worktree under the wrong parent (PR #946).
		//   2. When the branch was already attached elsewhere, `worktreePath` was
		//      reassigned to `result.existingPath`, which the original mark (and the
		//      clear just above) never covered.
		// Re-mark with the SAME long setup TTL, not the default: the owning session
		// is not committed until after the awaited `getBranches` below, which is
		// itself slow on SSH / large repos. A default 10s window could lapse before
		// `setSessions` runs, so keep the mark alive across that window too.
