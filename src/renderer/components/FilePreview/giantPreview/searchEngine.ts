/**
 * Pure search engine for the Giant tier preview.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   Phase 4 originally shipped Giant tier with CodeMirror's built-in search
 *   panel, which kept the match count and navigation entirely inside CM6.
 *   The app's own search bar above the preview saw "0 of 0" and the user
 *   ended up with two competing UIs for the same action.
 *
 *   This module replaces the panel-based flow. Given the doc text (CM6's
 *   `Text.toString()` is the supported way to slice the whole document) and
 *   a query, it returns every match as a `SearchHit`. The GiantPreview
 *   component then dispatches a CM6 transaction to select + scroll the
 *   current match — CM6's selection rendering paints the active match for
 *   free.
 *
 *   Trade-offs vs the panel:
 *     + Single coherent search UI across all three tiers
 *     + Match count visible in the app bar (chip-style)
 *
 *   Regex matching is supported via `options.regex` (the shared bar's regex
 *   mode); case-sensitive toggle / replace from the old panel are not.
 *
 * Pure (no DOM, no CM6 view), exhaustively tested.

/**
 * Locate every occurrence of `query` in `docText`. Empty query returns [].
 *
 * Non-overlapping semantics (matches CM6's `SearchCursor` default and JS's
 * `String.prototype.match` with a `g` flag). For example `'aa'` inside
 * `'aaaa'` returns matches at offsets 0 and 2, not 0/1/2.
 *
 * Case-insensitive by default (matches the Fast tier convention so the app's
 * search bar feels the same regardless of which tier is active).
 *
 * Giant tier has no logical "block" boundary — the whole doc is one stream —
 * so every hit reports `blockIndex: 0` and `offsetWithinBlock === sourceOffset`.
 * Keeping the shared shape means `useFilePreviewSearch` and the adapter
 * contract require no Giant-specific branching.
