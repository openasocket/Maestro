/**
 * Shared search contract for FilePreview tiers (Rich, Fast markdown, Fast text,
 * Giant). Single source of truth so every tier returns the same hit shape and
 * `useFilePreviewSearch` can route navigation uniformly.
 *
 * Why this lives in its own module:
 *   - Three tiers (markdownFast, textFast, giantPreview) each produce hits and
 *     consume an adapter. Without a shared module the interface would drift.
 *   - `useFilePreviewSearch` re-exports from here so callers don't have to
 *     decide between "is it the hook's type or the tier's type?".
