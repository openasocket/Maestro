/**
 * Generalized contribution-registry substrate (pure, bundle-safe).
 *
 * ONE merge contract for every plugin-extensible surface (themes, prompts,
 * commands, docked panels, sidebar items, ...), generalizing the two seams that
 * already work end-to-end: the ThemeContribution merge and createAgentRegistry's
 * collision rule. The contract:
 *  - ids are namespaced `<pluginId>/<localId>` for plugin entries, bare for built-ins;
 *  - BUILT-IN ALWAYS WINS a collision (a plugin can never shadow or impersonate a
 *    first-party surface), and an earlier plugin wins over a later duplicate;
 *  - a dropped entry is recorded as an error, never thrown - one bad item never
 *    breaks the surface;
 *  - every entry carries non-suppressible provenance so the UI can always show
 *    where a surface came from (anti-impersonation).
