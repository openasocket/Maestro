/**
 * Maestro Plugin Host API contract version.
 *
 * This is the SINGLE source of truth for the version of the host surface that
 * plugins are written against. It becomes a permanent, semver-managed public
 * contract the moment the first plugin ships (Track B Phase 1), so treat any
 * change here with the same care as a breaking API change:
 *
 * - Bump the PATCH when fixing a bug in host behavior that does not change the
 *   shape of what plugins can rely on.
 * - Bump the MINOR when ADDING a contribution point, manifest field, or host
 *   capability in a backward-compatible way (older plugins keep working).
 * - Bump the MAJOR when REMOVING or changing the meaning of any existing
 *   contribution point, manifest field, or host capability.
 *
 * A plugin declares the minimum host API it needs via `maestro.minHostApi` in
 * its plugin.json. The host loads the plugin only when its own version
 * satisfies that minimum (same-major, host >= min). See isHostApiCompatible.

 * The host API version this Maestro build implements. Bumped to 1.12.0 for the
 * backward-compatible additive `net:connect` capability plus its `net.connect`
 * / `net.send` / `net.close` host methods (hold an outbound persistent
 * websocket to a host scope, e.g. a Discord/Slack gateway; egress-classified).
 * 1.11.0 added virtual `groupings` contributions and the presentation-only
 * `ui:grouping` publish/clear methods; 1.10.0 added the backward-compatible,
 * data-only `iconPacks` contribution; 1.9.0 added host-rendered `hostViews`,
 * their `ui:hostView` capability, and the `ui.hostViewUpdate` /
 * `ui.hostViewRemove` RPC methods; 1.8.0 added `background.list`; 1.7.0 added
 * history/session/tab/transcript
 * write/decision/shell/storage SQL/fs watch/power/background capabilities plus
 * `history.entryAdded` and metadata-only `agent.completed` events; 1.6.0 added
 * `cue.runStarted` / `cue.runFinished`; 1.5.0 added `agent.exited` /
 * `agent.error` / `usage.updated` / `run.completed` + functional
 * `sidebar`/`activity-bar`/`toolbar` uiItem surfaces; 1.4.0 added the
 * `ui:contribute` / `ui:panel` / `ui:render-unsafe` UI capabilities; 1.3.0
 * added `tools` + `keybindings`; 1.2.0 added `transcripts:read`.
