/**
 * Cadenza views - small, agent-openable panels that display or track what the
 * user is working on. Opened via `maestro-cli view` (a "Poke" primitive), they
 * ride the same CLI -> WebSocket -> main -> `remote:cadenza` -> renderer bridge
 * that `notify_toast` uses.
 *
 * This is the first, additive slice of the larger view-first "dynamic interface"
 * the widget library is scaffolded toward: the agent composes what the user
 * sees, and the app handles how it looks (no agent-authored CSS).
 *
 * Shared across the CLI command, the main-process bridge handler, the preload
 * bridge, and the renderer store so all four layers agree on one payload shape.

/**
 * What a cadenza renders:
 *   tracker  - a live title + body line the agent updates in place
 *   file     - a pin to a file the user can expand into a File Preview tab
 *   markdown - rich content the agent wants to show (text, code, tables,
 *              lists), rendered through the app's Markdown renderer
 *   image    - a local image the agent wants to show, by path
 *   code     - a syntax-highlighted code snippet (from a file path or inline);
 *              pop several at once to show related code side by side
 *   view     - a custom view the agent composes from native building blocks
 *              (stat cards, sections, bars, donuts, ...) as a JSON spec in `body`
 *   decision - a prompt (`body`) plus `options` buttons; clicking one replies to
 *              the owning agent with that option's value (a live prompt inject)
