/**
 * Font-stack helpers.
 *
 * The interface font is a user setting (`fontFamily`). The font picker
 * (FontConfigurationPanel) and the custom-font input both store a BARE font
 * name with no generic fallback, e.g. `Roboto Mono`. When that bare name isn't
 * installed and isn't web-loaded (the common case on iOS / the web-desktop
 * bundle, where only JetBrains Mono is fetched), the browser can't resolve the
 * family and drops to its document default - which is a proportional SERIF
 * (Times) on Safari. The result is an app that renders in serif instead of
 * monospace.
 *
 * `withMonoFallback` guarantees the applied CSS font-family always ends in a
 * safe monospace chain: the platform's system monospace (`ui-monospace` / SF
 * Mono / Menlo on Apple, Consolas on Windows, Liberation Mono on Linux) and,
 * critically, the `monospace` generic keyword every platform honors. Apply it
 * at the point where the setting becomes a CSS value, NOT at the setting source
 * - the picker's `<select>` needs the raw stored name to match its options.
 */

/**
 * Safe monospace fallback chain appended to a bare interface font. Matches the
 * chain already used by the file-preview surfaces (proseStyles.ts,
 * themeAdapter.ts) so the whole app degrades to the same faces. Ends in the
 * `monospace` generic so no platform can fall through to serif.
